"""Semantic-drift gate (CI).

After the 2026-07 semantic-correction pass, this gate fails the build if any specific
UNCONDITIONAL overclaim phrasing reappears in the docs / Lean docstrings / publication
surfaces. Each entry overstates what the Lean kernel actually proves:

- "full Shoup theorem" — we prove only the *fixed-transcript affine collision core*.
- "proved Θ(√n)" — we prove the √n *arithmetic relations*, not a running-time complexity.
- "GLV never / universal no-go" — we prove *this reduction* preserves the exponent, scoped.
- "Semaev prime-field no advantage" — no *known* method; the asymptotics are *open* (Petit).
- unconditional Frobenius-trace claims — `t = p+1−n` is the trace only *given* `#E = n`.

This is deliberately a small curated substring list (like `check_counts.py`), not an NLP
classifier. A line that must legitimately quote a banned phrase (this file, a negation, or a
historical/quoted review) can be exempted with an inline `drift-check: ignore` marker.

Usage:  python3 scripts/check_semantic_drift.py
