# The NIST P-256 base point: exact order `n` (weak point-counting keystone)

Mirrors secp256k1's `Ecdlp/Proved/GeneratorOrder.lean` for the second live domain. The SEC 2
generator `G = (Gx, Gy)`, realized in Mathlib's elliptic-curve point group `P256.toAffine.Point`,
has **exact order `n`** (the published prime group order), so `⟨G⟩` is cyclic of order `n`.

This is the **weak point-counting keystone**: it pins the cryptographic subgroup without
computing `#E(𝔽_p)` (no Hasse/Schoof). Proof: `n • G = 0` (native-evaluated 256-bit
double-and-add over 𝔽_p) and `G ≠ 0`, with `n` prime (`P256PrimeN`) — so `addOrderOf G = n`
by `addOrderOf_eq_prime`. Like every `native_decide` fact here it additionally trusts the Lean
compiler (`TRUST_REPORT.md`). It does **not** give the strong keystone `#E(𝔽_p) = n` (cofactor
1), which still needs the Hasse bound — this is the base-point subgroup `⟨G⟩`.
