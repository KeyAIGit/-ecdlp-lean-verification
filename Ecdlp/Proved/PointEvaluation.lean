# Function evaluation at a rational point (Weil-pairing infrastructure, layer B)

The Weil pairing evaluates a rational function (the Miller function `f_P`) at points of the curve.
Mathlib v4.31 has **no** rational-function evaluation API — the coordinate ring `F[E]` is not even
known to be a Dedekind domain there, so the `HeightOneSpectrum` valuation/divisor apparatus does
not apply out of the box. This file builds the **first rung** of that missing infrastructure: the
evaluation of a **regular** function (an element of the affine coordinate ring `F[E]`) at a
rational point `P = (x,y) ∈ E`, as a genuine ring homomorphism `F[E] →+* F`.

The construction rides on Mathlib's `CoordinateRing.quotientXYIdealEquiv`, the `F`-algebra
isomorphism `F[E] / ⟨X−x, Y−y⟩ ≃ F` (evaluation modulo the maximal ideal at `P`). Composing the
quotient map with that isomorphism gives point-evaluation. Two structural facts are proved: it is
**surjective** (every value in `F` is attained, so `P` is an `F`-rational point) and its **kernel
is exactly the maximal ideal `⟨X−x, Y−y⟩`** of `P` — the regular functions vanishing at `P`.

This is regular-function evaluation only; extending it to rational functions regular at `P`
(needed to evaluate `f_P`, which has zeros/poles) is the next rung, via localization at the maximal
ideal — see `notes/FOUNDATIONS.md` (Weil sub-ladder, W3 evaluation half).

(`quotientXYIdealEquiv`) being a field. This is the prerequisite for localizing at `P` (the local
ring `F[E]_P`), the next rung, to evaluate rational functions regular at `P`. -/
