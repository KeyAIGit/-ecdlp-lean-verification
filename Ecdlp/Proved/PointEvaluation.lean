# ⚠ PENDING KERNEL CONFIRMATION — not imported from `Ecdlp.lean`.
This rung has not yet passed a green `lake build` (the last CI verdict on it was red, from an
earlier `IsPrime`-synthesis failure since addressed by adding an explicit instance argument, but
the fix is unverified). It is deliberately kept OUT of the built corpus so the repository invariant
"green build = all proved" holds. Re-add `import Ecdlp.Proved.PointEvaluation` to `Ecdlp.lean`
**only** once CI confirms this file builds with no `sorry`.

# Function evaluation at a rational point (Weil-pairing infrastructure, layer B)

The Weil pairing evaluates a rational function (the Miller function `f_P`) at points of the curve.
Mathlib v4.31 has **no** rational-function evaluation API — the coordinate ring `F[E]` is not even
known to be a Dedekind domain there, so the `HeightOneSpectrum` valuation/divisor apparatus does
not apply out of the box. This file builds the **first rungs** of that missing infrastructure: the
evaluation of a **regular** function (an element of the affine coordinate ring `F[E]`) at a
rational point `P = (x,y) ∈ E`, as a genuine ring homomorphism `F[E] →+* F`, and its extension to
**rational** functions regular at `P` via localization.

The construction rides on Mathlib's `CoordinateRing.quotientXYIdealEquiv`, the `F`-algebra
isomorphism `F[E] / ⟨X−x, Y−y⟩ ≃ F` (evaluation modulo the maximal ideal at `P`). Composing the
quotient map with that isomorphism gives point-evaluation. Structural facts proved: it is
**surjective** (every value in `F` is attained, so `P` is an `F`-rational point), its **kernel
is exactly the maximal ideal `⟨X−x, Y−y⟩`** of `P`, that ideal is **maximal** (`P` is a closed
point), the **residue field at `P` is `F`**, and the rational-function evaluation
`Localization.AtPrime ⟨X−x,Y−y⟩ →+* F` (rational functions regular at `P` → their value at `P`).

See `notes/FOUNDATIONS.md` (Weil sub-ladder, W3 evaluation half).
