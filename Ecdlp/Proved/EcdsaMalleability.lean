# ECDSA signature malleability — the algebraic core of BIP-146 low-`s`

Every ECDSA signature `(r, s)` has a *sibling* `(r, −s)` (i.e. `(r, n − s)` in `ZMod n`) that
verifies against the same message and public key. This non-uniqueness is **signature
malleability** — the reason Bitcoin's BIP-62 rule 5 / BIP-146 (and, as library policy,
implementations such as libsecp256k1) normalize to "low `s`": third parties could flip `s ↦ n − s` on any ECDSA signature and
obtain a *different* valid encoding of the same authorization (a source of transaction-ID
malleation before SegWit).

This file records the two machine-checkable halves of that fact, in the repo's established
identity-level style (`ABSTRACT_SCOPE.md`: no adversary, no hash, no probability space —
the *algebra* of the attack, not a protocol-security statement):

* **Signing side (abstract field).** The signing equation `s·k = z + r·x` is satisfied by
  the sibling pair `(−s, −k)`: `(−s)·(−k) = z + r·x` (`ecdsa_sibling_signing_equation`).
  The sibling signature is the one the signer *would* have produced with nonce `−k` — and
  `(−k)·G = −(k·G)` has the same `x`-coordinate, so `r` is unchanged.
* **Verifier side (concrete secp256k1).** The verifier accepts `(r, s)` iff
  `r = x((z/s)·G + (r/s)·P)`. Negating `s` negates both scalars (`a / (−s) = −(a / s)`,
  `ecdsa_sibling_scalars`), which negates the verification point
  (`secp256k1_pointX_neg_zsmul_add`) — and point negation on secp256k1 **fixes the
  `x`-coordinate** (`secp256k1_pointX_neg`: `−(x, y) = (x, −y)` since `a₁ = a₃ = 0`), so the
  sibling's verification point yields the same `r`.

The `x`-projection is `pointX : E(𝔽_p) → Option (ZMod p)` (`none` at infinity). What is
**not** claimed: no formalized `Verify` predicate, no statement about hash truncation, the
real verifier's `ZMod p → ZMod n` reduction of the `x`-coordinate before comparing with `r`,
DER/encoding-level malleability, or uniqueness after low-`s` normalization.

Trust note: no `native_decide` appears in this file, and the field-side lemmas are
pure-kernel. The curve-side lemma `secp256k1_pointX_neg_zsmul_add` is stated under
`[Fact (Nat.Prime Secp256k1.p)]` (the repo convention); discharging that fact downstream
uses the Pratt certificate (`Secp256k1PrimeP.lean`), which relies on `native_decide` — so
*instantiated* curve-side results inherit the concrete curve layer's compiler-trusted base
(`Lean.ofReduceBool`), exactly as every other concrete secp256k1 point-level result here.

signing identity for nonce `k`, hash `z`, private key `x`), then the sibling pair
`(−s, −k)` satisfies the *same* equation: `(−s)·(−k) = z + r·x`. Since `(−k)·G = −(k·G)`
has the same `x`-coordinate (`secp256k1_pointX_neg`), the sibling's `r` is unchanged —
so `(r, −s)` is a well-formed signature on the same message under the same key. -/
