# NIST P-256: the rational-point group is finite, and `n ∣ #E(𝔽_p)`

Mirrors secp256k1's `Ecdlp/Proved/CurveCardinality.lean` for the P-256 domain. The first
verified rung about the curve cardinality `#E(𝔽_p)` itself (all prior P-256 point-counting
work stayed inside the base-point subgroup `⟨G⟩`). Two facts:

* `Finite P256.toAffine.Point` — the group of `𝔽_p`-rational points is finite (points inject
  into `Option (𝔽_p × 𝔽_p)`, which is finite since `𝔽_p` is). Without this, Mathlib's
  `Nat.card E.toAffine.Point` is junk `0`; with it, the count is real.
* `p256_n_dvd_card_point : P256.n ∣ Nat.card P256.toAffine.Point` — the prime base-point order
  divides `#E` (Lagrange on `⟨G⟩`, whose order is the proved `n`).

This is only the **weak keystone**: it pins `#E ∈ {n, 2n, 3n, …}`. The **strong keystone**
`#E = n` (cofactor 1) is **NOT** proved here for P-256. The secp256k1 curve-specific route
(`CurveCardinalityExact.lean`: `#E ≤ 2p+1 < 3n` together with `E[2] = {O}`, the latter from
`−7` being a non-cube so there is no nonzero 2-torsion) is `j = 0`-specific and does **not**
transfer to P-256, whose `j`-invariant is nonzero (`c₄ = 144 ≠ 0`). A strong keystone for
P-256 would require the general Hasse bound, still absent from Mathlib v4.31.
