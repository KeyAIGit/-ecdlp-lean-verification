# Degree of the secp256k1 2-division polynomial (torsion point count)

The 2-division polynomial `Ψ₂Sq = 4X³ + 28` has **degree 3** over `𝔽_p`, so it has
at most 3 roots — hence secp256k1 has at most 3 nontrivial 2-torsion `x`-coordinates,
i.e. `#E[2] ≤ 4` (the three order-2 points plus `O`). This is the first concrete
*torsion-count* fact, the degree side of the division-polynomial picture (Mathlib's
`DivisionPolynomial.Degree`). Uses the machine-checked primality of `p` (so `𝔽_p`
is a field / has no zero divisors and the leading coefficient `4 ≠ 0`).

/-- **At most 3 two-torsion `x`-coordinates.** Since `Ψ₂Sq` has degree 3, it has at
most 3 roots in `𝔽_p`; these are exactly the `x`-coordinates of the order-2 points,
so secp256k1 has at most 3 nontrivial 2-torsion points (`#E[2] ≤ 4` with `O`). -/
