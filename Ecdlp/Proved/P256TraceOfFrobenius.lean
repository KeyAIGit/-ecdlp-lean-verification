# NIST P-256's trace of Frobenius: ordinary, non-anomalous, Hasse-consistent

The live P-256 domain's Smart/SSSA attack-boundary rung, mirroring secp256k1's
`Ecdlp/Proved/TraceOfFrobenius.lean`. For P-256 with group order `#E = n` (the published,
kernel-verified prime order; cofactor 1) the **trace of Frobenius** is `t = p + 1 − n`. Two
classical transfer attacks are governed by `t`:

* `t = 0` ⟺ supersingular ⟺ small embedding degree (feasible MOV/Frey–Rück);
* `t = 1` ⟺ `#E = p`, i.e. anomalous ⟺ the Smart / Semaev–Satoh–Araki (SSSA) `p`-adic
  elliptic-logarithm attack solves ECDLP in linear time.

This file machine-checks (over `ℤ`, from `#E = n`) that P-256 avoids both and is
Hasse-consistent: `t ≠ 0` (ordinary), `t ≠ 1` (not anomalous — SSSA inapplicable), and
`t² ≤ 4p` (the Hasse bound `|t| ≤ 2√p`; here `t` is a 127-bit number, well inside the
range, confirming cofactor 1). Together with `P256EmbeddingDegree.lean` these are the
verified boundary nodes: ECDLP on P-256 does not leak through MOV/FR or Smart/SSSA.

Scope note: as for secp256k1, the statement is conditional on the published `#E = n`
(cofactor 1) — the *strong* keystone `#E(𝔽_p) = n` still needs the Hasse bound / point
counting, absent from Mathlib. What is verified here is the exact arithmetic that makes the
attack boundary hold *given* that order.
