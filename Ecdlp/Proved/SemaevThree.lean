# Semaev's third summation polynomial `S₃`

Formalizes Semaev's 3rd summation polynomial for a short Weierstrass curve
`y² = x³ + a·x + b` and proves its **forward direction**: whenever a field element `x₃`
is the `x`-coordinate of the chord-sum of two curve points `(x₁,y₁), (x₂,y₂)` (the
`x₁ ≠ x₂` "chord" case), the triple `(x₁,x₂,x₃)` is a root of `S₃`. Equivalently: if
three affine points with these `x`-coordinates satisfy `P₁ + P₂ + P₃ = O`, then
`S₃(x₁,x₂,x₃) = 0`.

Summation polynomials (Semaev, 2004) are the algebraic backbone of index-calculus /
Gröbner-basis attacks on ECDLP over extension fields; `Sₙ = 0` encodes the existence of
`n` curve points with prescribed `x`-coordinates summing to `O`, and `S₃` is their base
case. To our knowledge this is the first formalization of a Semaev summation polynomial in
Lean/Mathlib. It is a **construction** (a barrier item in `BARRIERS.md`, "Semaev
polynomials"), not an attack: the forward implication is a necessary condition, and by
itself computes nothing about any discrete log — it enriches the verified substrate.

**Certificate provenance (Fable → kernel).** The two ring identities driving the proof —
the cofactor identity `(x₁−x₂)²·S₃ = T² − 4·f₁·f₂` and the syzygy
`N = (2·y₁·y₂ − T) − (y₁²−f₁) − (y₂²−f₂)`, with `fᵢ = xᵢ³ + a·xᵢ + b`,
`T = (x₁+x₂)(x₁·x₂+a) + 2b − (x₁−x₂)²·x₃`, and `N = (x₁−x₂)²(x₁+x₂+x₃) − (y₂−y₁)²` —
were designed and verified by exact symbolic computation (sympy: Gröbner reduction plus an
independent iterated-resultant elimination) before transcription; here the Lean kernel
re-checks them via `linear_combination`/`ring`. The `y₁·y₂` cross term is eliminated by
conjugate multiplication, which is precisely why `S₃` is sign-symmetric — it captures the
`x`-coordinate of both `P₁+P₂` and `P₁−P₂` (the two roots of `S₃(x₁,x₂,·)`).

/-- **Semaev's 3rd summation polynomial** for `y² = x³ + a·x + b`:
`S₃(x₁,x₂,x₃) = (x₁−x₂)²·x₃² − 2·((x₁+x₂)(x₁·x₂+a)+2b)·x₃ + ((x₁·x₂−a)² − 4b·(x₁+x₂))`.
It is symmetric in its three arguments (`S₃_symm₁₂`, `S₃_symm₂₃`), and — as proved below —
`S₃(x₁,x₂,x₃) = 0` whenever three affine points with those `x`-coordinates sum to `O`. -/

variable {K : Type*} [Field K]

/-- **Forward direction of Semaev's `S₃` (chord case).** For a short Weierstrass curve
`y² = x³ + a·x + b` over a field: if `(x₁,y₁)` and `(x₂,y₂)` lie on the curve with
`x₁ ≠ x₂`, and `x₃` is the `x`-coordinate of their chord-sum — stated in the
cleared-denominator form `(x₁−x₂)²·(x₁+x₂+x₃) = (y₂−y₁)²`, i.e.
`x₃ = ((y₂−y₁)/(x₂−x₁))² − x₁ − x₂` — then `S₃(x₁,x₂,x₃) = 0`.

Contrapositively: a triple `(x₁,x₂,x₃)` that is **not** a root of `S₃` can never arise as
the `x`-coordinates of three collinear points of `E`. The proof is the certified two-step
elimination: `hchord` and the curve equations give `2·y₁·y₂ = T`; squaring and applying the
cofactor identity yields `(x₁−x₂)²·S₃ = T² − 4·f₁·f₂ = 0`, and `(x₁−x₂)² ≠ 0` cancels. -/
