# ABSTRACT_SCOPE.md — Honest scope map of the "discrete-log cryptography library"

> Answers REVIEW_DOSSIER.md **Finding 1** ("The 'discrete-log cryptography
> library' is abstract algebra mislabeled as cryptography").

## Canonical accounting

- **114 ledger rows / ~105 distinct kernel-verified results** (9 rows are
  alternate-form / supporting restatements of an already-counted result).
- **0 `sorry`** anywhere in the built (`Ecdlp/`-minus-`Targets/`) tree.
- **No CUSTOM axioms.** Everything depends only on Lean/Mathlib's standard
  trusted core `{propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}`. Results discharged by
  `native_decide` **additionally** trust the Lean compiler via the
  `Lean.ofReduceBool` axiom — a *real* extension of the trusted computing base,
  not a logical axiom. This is machine-enforced by the axiom-audit CI gate
  (`Ecdlp/AxiomAudit.lean` + `scripts/check_axioms.py`), which fails the build if
  any other axiom (or a `sorryAx`) appears in a result's transitive dependencies.

## 1. Honest framing (one paragraph)

This is a **verified abstract protocol algebra**, not a cryptographic security
proof. Every theorem in the four files audited below is a one-line algebraic
identity stated over an *arbitrary* `[AddCommGroup G] [Module (ZMod n) G]` module
or an *arbitrary* `[Field F]` — never over the concrete secp256k1 point group.
The proofs are correct, reusable, and faithfully capture the *equational* content
of the protocols (an honest Schnorr signature verifies; two transcripts pin down
the witness; Pedersen commitments add). But they encode **no security
definition**: there is no adversary, no random oracle / hash, no probability
space, no negligibility, and no reduction to discrete-log hardness. In
particular "special soundness" here is a *linear-algebra fact* —
`x = (s₁ − s₂)/(c₁ − c₂)` solves a linear system — that holds in **any** field,
including fields where the discrete-log problem is trivial. None of these results
is ever instantiated at the secp256k1 curve group; the only point where the
scalar field is specialized to `ZMod Secp256k1.n` (`secp256k1_schnorr_extract`)
still proves the same field-algebra identity, just with `F := ZMod n` plugged in,
and touches no group element. The right label is *"a verified, reusable
discrete-log protocol algebra"* — valuable verified engineering of textbook
identities, not new cryptography and not a curve-specific security theorem.

## 2. Theorem-by-theorem table

Legend for "abstract structure":
- **Module** = `{G} [AddCommGroup G] {n : ℕ} [Module (ZMod n) G]` (an abstract
  finite abelian group of exponent ∣ n, with `s • g` as scalar multiplication).
- **Field** = `{F} [Field F]` (an abstract field — the scalar field only).
- **Field@n** = the same Field result with `F` specialized to `ZMod Secp256k1.n`
  (still no curve group; just a different scalar field).

| Theorem | File | Abstract structure | What it proves | What it does NOT prove |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `schnorr_verify` | DlogCompleteness | Module | Honest Schnorr/EdDSA sig verifies: `s•g = R + c•p` when `p=x•g, R=r•g, s=r+c·x`. | Nothing about an adversary/forgery; no hash/Fiat-Shamir; no probability; not at secp256k1. Completeness, not unforgeability. |
| `dh_agree` | DlogCompleteness | Module | Diffie–Hellman agreement: `a•(b•g) = b•(a•g)`. Proof is `mul_comm`. | Not the DH/CDH *assumption*; says nothing about a passive adversary's advantage; pure commutativity. |
| `threshold_schnorr_aggregate` | DlogCompleteness | Module + `Finset` | Aggregate (shared-challenge) Schnorr/MuSig/FROST sum verifies. | No rogue-key resistance, no adversary, no security model; just distributes `∑` over `•`. |
| `feldman_vss_verify` | DlogCompleteness | Module + `Finset` | Feldman VSS share `f(i)•g = ∑ⱼ (iʲ)•(aⱼ•g)`. | No secrecy / binding / soundness against a cheating dealer; an evaluation-vs-commitment identity. |
| `musig_key_aggregate` | DlogCompleteness | Module + `Finset` | MuSig coefficient-weighted key aggregate `∑ aᵢ•Pᵢ = (∑ aᵢ·xᵢ)•g`. | No key-aggregation security; no adversary choosing keys; algebra only. |
| `threshold_elgamal_combine` | DlogCompleteness | Module + `Finset` | Partial-decryption combine `∑ xᵢ•C₁ = (∑ xᵢ)•C₁`. | No threshold-security / robustness; `Finset.sum_smul`. |
| `schnorr_batch_verify` | DlogCompleteness | Module + `Finset` | Per-challenge batch verification equation holds. | No batch-forgery / soundness-error bound; an algebraic regrouping. |
| `adaptor_complete` | DlogCompleteness | Module | Adaptor pre-sig adapts: `((r+c·x)+t)•g = (R+T)+c•P`. | No atomicity / witness-hiding / extraction security; completeness identity. |
| `taproot_tweak_verify` | DlogCompleteness | Module | Taproot key-tweak spend verifies: `s•g = R + c•(P+t•g)`. Proof is `module`. | No BIP-341 security claim; no adversary; tactic-closed linear identity. |
| `elgamal_decrypt` | DlogPrimitives | Module | ElGamal decryption correctness `(m+r•(x•g)) − x•(r•g) = m`. | No IND-CPA / semantic security; correctness only. |
| `pedersen_homomorphic` | DlogPrimitives | Module | Pedersen additivity `Com(a,b)+Com(a',b') = Com(a+a',b+b')`. | No hiding, no binding (binding is a *separate* field lemma, see below); homomorphism only. |
| `elgamal_rerandomize_decrypt` | DlogPrimitives | Module | Re-randomized ciphertext still decrypts to `m`. | No unlinkability / IND-CPA-security claim; correctness. |
| `elgamal_additively_homomorphic` | DlogPrimitives | Module | `Enc(m₁;r₁)+Enc(m₂;r₂) = Enc(m₁+m₂;r₁+r₂)`. | No homomorphic-encryption security; component-wise identity. |
| `pedersen_vector_homomorphic` | DlogPrimitives | Module + `Finset` | Vector-Pedersen additivity over a `Finset`. | No vector-commitment binding / soundness; algebra. |
| `schnorr_extract` | SchnorrSoundness | **Field** | 2-transcript extractor: `x = (s₁−s₂)/(c₁−c₂)` from `sᵢ=r+cᵢ·x`, `c₁≠c₂`. | **Not** a reduction to DL-hardness; no adversary, no extractor-runtime/probability; holds in *any* field, incl. DL-trivial ones. Solving a linear equation. |
| `schnorr_witness_unique` | SchnorrSoundness | Field | The extracted witness is unique. | Uniqueness of a solution to a linear system; no knowledge-soundness machinery. |
| `pedersen_binding_extract` | SchnorrSoundness | Field | A binding collision yields the trapdoor `h=(a'−a)/(b−b')`. | Trapdoor `h = log_G H` is an *uninterpreted field element*; no actual group/DLP; no hardness assumption; no probability. "Binding ⇐ DLP" is *narrated*, not formalized. |
| `adaptor_extract` | SchnorrSoundness | Field | `t = s − s'`. Proof is `ring`. | No adaptor-signature security; subtraction. |
| `blind_unblind` | SchnorrSoundness | Field | `s = s' + α`. Proof is `ring`. | No blindness / one-more-unforgeability; subtraction. |
| `secp256k1_schnorr_extract` | SchnorrSoundness | **Field@n** (`ZMod Secp256k1.n`, needs `[Fact n.Prime]`) | Same extractor, scalar field set to the secp256k1 scalar field. | **Still no curve group.** Specializes `F`, not `G`; no point ever appears; same field algebra; no adversary/probability/security. The only "secp256k1" theorem here, and it is *not* about `E(𝔽_p)`. |
| `okamoto_extract` | DlogAdvanced | Field | Okamoto 2-witness extraction via two `schnorr_extract` calls. | Not a reduction; representation-problem hardness untouched; field algebra. |
| `chaum_pedersen_verify` | DlogAdvanced (`DLEQ` ns) | Module | DLEQ completeness: both `s•g=R₁+c•a` and `s•h=R₂+c•b`. | No DLEQ soundness/zero-knowledge; no adversary; completeness identity. |

**Summary of the column "what it does NOT prove," in one line:** none of these
21 theorems contains an adversary, a hash/random oracle, a probability space, a
security game, or a discrete-log hardness assumption — and none is stated over
`secp256k1.toAffine.Point`. The Field-level "soundness" theorems are linear
algebra true in every field.

## 3. Instantiation feasibility at the real secp256k1 group

**Setup that already exists in the repo.** `Ecdlp/Proved/Secp256k1Curve.lean`
defines `secp256k1 : WeierstrassCurve (ZMod Secp256k1.p)`, proves it is an
`EllipticCurve` / `IsElliptic`, and thereby gives Mathlib's group law on
`G := secp256k1.toAffine.Point`, which carries an `AddCommGroup` instance.
`Ecdlp/Proved/Secp256k1PrimeN.lean` discharges `[Fact (Nat.Prime Secp256k1.n)]`
via a full Pratt certificate. So the curve group object and the primality of the
group order both genuinely exist; what is missing is the bridge that lets the
abstract protocol theorems *fire* on that group.

**The one structural obstacle: `Module (ZMod n) G` is not available.** Every
Completeness/Primitives theorem is quantified over `[Module (ZMod n) G]`. To
instantiate any of them at `G = secp256k1.toAffine.Point` with `n = Secp256k1.n`,
you must supply a `Module (ZMod Secp256k1.n) (secp256k1.toAffine.Point)` instance
— i.e. exhibit the point group as a vector-space-like module over the scalar
*ring* `ZMod n`. Mathlib does **not** provide this for `WeierstrassCurve.Point`.
What Mathlib gives for free is only the `ℤ`-module structure (every
`AddCommGroup` is a `Module ℤ`), with `zsmul`. There is no general theorem
"a finite abelian group whose exponent divides `n` is a `ZMod n`-module," and
`WeierstrassCurve.Point` is not equipped with one. Concretely, the missing facts
are:

1. **Order/exponent fact.** You need `n • P = 0` for every `P`
   (`secp256k1.toAffine.Point` has order `n`, cofactor 1). Mathlib has no proof
   that this Mathlib-defined point group is cyclic of order `n`; establishing the
   group order of `E(𝔽_p)` is itself a substantial theorem (point counting /
   Hasse), absent from Mathlib and absent here. Without `n • P = 0` you cannot
   even *define* the `ZMod n`-action `(a : ZMod n) • P` coherently.
2. **The `ZMod n`-action.** Given `n • P = 0`, the action `ZMod n → End(G)`
   factors `ℤ → End(G)` through `ZMod n`. Building this `Module (ZMod n) G`
   instance from `AddMonoid.zsmul` + the exponent fact is a real (if mechanical)
   Mathlib development — `AddCommGroup.zmodModule`-style — but it *requires* fact
   (1), which is the hard part.

**How hard, concretely?**

- *Instantiating a Field-level theorem* (`schnorr_extract`, `okamoto_extract`,
  `pedersen_binding_extract`, `adaptor_extract`, `blind_unblind`) at the real
  curve is **trivial and already essentially done**: `secp256k1_schnorr_extract`
  shows the pattern — set `F := ZMod Secp256k1.n`, supply `[Fact n.Prime]`
  (we have it), done. But this is *not* an instantiation "at the curve group" —
  it never mentions `E(𝔽_p)`. It instantiates the scalar field, which proves
  nothing new cryptographically. So it is cheap and unilluminating.
- *Instantiating a Module-level theorem* (`schnorr_verify`, `dh_agree`,
  `pedersen_homomorphic`, the `Finset` aggregates, …) at `E(𝔽_p)` is **the real
  task**, and it is blocked on obstacle (1) above: proving
  `#(secp256k1.toAffine.Point) = n` (equivalently `n • P = 0` for all `P`).
  That is a curve-cardinality / torsion result that Mathlib does not have for a
  concrete 256-bit curve and that `native_decide` cannot reach (the group is
  astronomically large; you cannot enumerate it). It would need genuine
  arithmetic-geometry machinery (a verified Schoof-style or
  division-polynomial-based order argument). This is the same class of missing
  fact that blocks the GLV `glvPoint = [λ]` claim (see below) and is the true
  bottleneck — not the protocol algebra itself.

**Is it worth doing?** Two honest answers:

- **For the protocol theorems specifically: no, low value.** Instantiating, say,
  `schnorr_verify` at `E(𝔽_p)` would not produce a security theorem — it would
  still be the completeness identity `s•g = R + c•p`, now with `•` being curve
  scalar-mul. The cryptographic content (unforgeability, knowledge-soundness
  against an adversary, Fiat–Shamir in the ROM) is *absent at the abstract level
  and would remain absent after instantiation.* You would pay a large
  proof-engineering cost (the group-order theorem) to upgrade "true in any
  module" to "true in this one module," with no new security guarantee. Not worth
  it as a way to make the library "real cryptography."
- **For the curve-cardinality lemma itself: yes, high value — but as its own
  deliverable.** A verified `#E(𝔽_p) = n` (and the resulting
  `Module (ZMod n) (secp256k1.toAffine.Point)` instance) is exactly the missing
  keystone that (a) would let *all* Module-level protocol theorems instantiate at
  once, and (b) is the prerequisite for the genuinely interesting GLV claim
  `glvPoint = [λ]` on `⟨G⟩`. That theorem is reusable, absent from Mathlib, and
  mathematically substantive. The right framing is: *the protocol algebra is
  finished scaffolding; the worthwhile next target is the curve-order / module
  instance, after which instantiation is a one-liner and the GLV eigenvalue fact
  becomes reachable.*

## Cross-reference: the GLV map (Finding 3 context)

The GLV endomorphism is genuinely proved to be an **additive** endomorphism:
`glvPoint_add` (`Ecdlp/Proved/GlvHom.lean`) proves
`glvPoint (P + Q) = glvPoint P + glvPoint Q` over the real curve group
`secp256k1.toAffine.Point`, and it is bundled as
`glvHom : Point →+ Point` (an `AddMonoidHom`). This is a real, delicate
full-branch affine-slope proof and the most substantive new result in the tree.
However, `glvPoint = [λ]` — that `glvPoint G = λ • G`, the eigenvalue identity
that is the *cryptographic point* of GLV — is **not proved anywhere**. It depends
on exactly the same missing scalar-multiplication / curve-order machinery
described above. Additivity ≠ the `[λ]` eigenvalue fact; the latter remains open.
